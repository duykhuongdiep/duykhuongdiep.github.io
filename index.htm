			<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<div class="top-divider"></div>
				<div class="content">
						<p>My interest in IT started back when I was in elementary school, as I learned how to use MS-DOS to navigate and create simple files and directory.
							The fact that a computer can do all sort of thing by command greatly interest me.
							As a result, I continually improve my knowledge to be well fit for the IT industry.</p>
						<p>Knowing from the beginning being a programmer is my career of choice following years of working in different industry after graduated Diploma in Information Technology,
							I decided to push myself further by coming to RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology.
							RMIT's course structure indeed offers what I need for updating my skill sets in the dynamic world of IT.</p>
						<p>When applying for the course, in addition to programming and contemporary technologies,
							I expect to learn more about soft skills such as team collaboration, communication techniques and analysing.
							Those skills have been increasingly becoming more significant in the modern IT industry.</p>

			<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
				<div class="top-divider"></div>
				<div class="content">
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>The project scope includes designing and developing software that keeps track of grocery items currently being kept in the household.
							Consequently, using such data to assist in ordering consumed items, finding coupons to items, and notify when particular items are on a discount.</p>
						<p>For additional developments, the software could be implemented to various platforms and hardware such as mobile apps, web interfaces for remote control and RasperyPi for local control.
							Statistical features such as graphs and charts may be generated to inform users of habits of consuming thus giving appropriate health recommendations.</p>
						<h2>Motivation</h2>
						<p>There are many grocery listing apps and software on the market currently, such as Grocery Pal, Out of Milk, Grocery iQ ..., but their main features often are focusing on generating portable shopping lists.
							Consequently, existing a large market gap for grocery list tracking software which integrates itself into the smart home or IoT environment.</p>
						<p>The project considered useful as it assists in making daily routine automatically,
							therefore users can spend more time more on food preparation and cooking which lead to better diet quality and health, according to Pablo Monsivais, Anju Aggarwal, Adam Drewnowski (2014). </p>
						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>The first stage of development includes computer software with primary features such as grocery items listing and automatic reordering. Additionally, should an item needs restocking, it will inform the user of appropriate online coupons or discounts.
							Initially, users can choose to input list of items manually or scan its barcodes into the system for it to begin handling records. The later feature will available after completion of the second stage.
							When an item is out of stock, users will mark that to the system. From there, a range of options will be provided, whether take that item off the listing,
							or reorder using automatic reordering system. The ordering process could be made more efficient by including online discount code and price comparison.</p>
						<p>After core features are established and operational, the second stage of software development will initiate.
							In this stage, additional components will be included to further enhance software capability and better integration into smart home ecosystems.
							Integration of smartphone components can add more interaction to the software such as barcode scanning, remote controlling. The system program and database will subsequently transfer to a RasberryPi with touchscreen included providing users with a single physical device without the need of a computer. More importantly, this device can operate around the clock and continuously inform users of health advises and statistical information based on consuming habit.</p>
						<h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
						<p>A mixture of software and hardware are needed to develop this system includes:</p>
						<li>Any Java integrated development environment such as Eclipse. Java is indeed a programming language of choice for this particular project because of its ability to be deployed on multiple platforms.
							This IDE is the primary application for the project's development.</li>
						<li>A GitHub repository will be used for version control and enabling team collaboration.</li>
						<li>For hardware component, a RaspberryPi board with a touchscreen attached by GPIO ports, which all being put inside an enclosure to protect the unit from external damage.
							This device will be installed with a lightweight operating system namely Raspbian Stretch Lite or RISC OS to be operational.</li>
						<h2>Skills required</h2>
						<p>To be able to develop the project, developers must have experiences in Java programing language and skills in program integration to multiple platforms. Basic knowledge with different hardware components such as smartphones and RaspberryPi is also a requirement.
							The project considered feasible as required skills are at an immediate level, therefore it should not be a difficulty getting developers with appropriate knowledge.</p>
						<h2>Outcome</h2>
						<p>The project when developed will considerably assist users in everyday routine by automation the process. More importantly, it will present more alternatives to managing grocery stocks.
							By simplify the process and provide statistical information, it will reduce meal preparation time, promote a healthy selection of grocery, which can lead to more home cooking meals ratio than fast food.
							Overall, the project if successful may provide a positive impact on users diet and lifestyle</p>
