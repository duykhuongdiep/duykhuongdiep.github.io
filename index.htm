			<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<div class="top-divider"></div>
				<div class="content">
						<p>My interest in IT started back when I was in elementary school, as I learned how to use MS-DOS to navigate and create simple files and directory.
							The fact that a computer can do all sort of thing by command greatly interest me.
							As a result, I continually improve my knowledge to be well fit for the IT industry.</p>
						<p>Knowing from the beginning being a programmer is my career of choice following years of working in different industry after graduated Diploma in Information Technology,
							I decided to push myself further by coming to RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology.
							RMIT's course structure indeed offers what I need for updating my skill sets in the dynamic world of IT.</p>
						<p>When applying for the course, in addition to programming and contemporary technologies,
							I expect to learn more about soft skills such as team collaboration, communication techniques and analysing.
							Those skills have been increasingly becoming more significant in the modern IT industry.</p>
